Slytherin vs Gryffindor --- simple snake game
After learning the basics of front end development, I started with the snake project and creating a simple snake game rebranding it to make it seem as a Harry Potter game as well.

This is just a concept exercise for me to better understand query selector, document, get element by ID.
linking files, creating better understanding of GitHub read me files,
arrow functions,
do,while statements,
how functions work and how if statements are produced and run within the code blocks,
setting time intervals
justify content,
align-items
